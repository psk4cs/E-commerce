        <p>Yeah, she dances to her own beat. Oh, no. You could've been the greatest. 'Cause, baby, <a href="#">you're a firework</a>. Maybe a reason why all the doors are closed. Open up your heart and just let it begin. So très chic, yeah, she's a classic.</p>

        <p>You give a hundred reasons why, and you say you're really gonna try. Straight stuntin' yeah we do it like that. Calling out my name. ‘Cause I, I’m capable of anything.</p>
